Hello {{ message.recipient_name }}!

You've just received a happiness packet{% if message.sender_named %}from {{ message.sender_name }}{% endif %}!
{% if not message.sender_named %}The sender asked to remain anonymous.{% endif %}

If this is the first time you've heard about Happiness Packets # TODO insert brief

Here's what they wrote:

We'd like to be able to publish some of the happiness packets, but we'll
only do so after opt-in of both you and the sender. To give permission for
this, please go to:
{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'messaging:recipient_message_update' identifier=message.identifier token=message.recipient_email_token %}
This is entirely optional.

Have a great day!
